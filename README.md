# Full Stack E-Commerce Clothing Website
This project is a full stack e-commerce website built with Next js. I created this project as an exercise to develop my web development skills, especially to learn about Next js.


## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided
- Implementing cart functionality 
- Connecting to Sanity as back end database for e-commerce
- Connecting Stripe APIs to power online payment processing for e-commerce

### Links
The live site is deployed in vercel, but it seems that vercel can't render swiper js. In the meantime i'm still trying to find a solution
- [Live Site URL](https://full-stack-ecommerce-clothing-web.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework for Production
- [react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - JS library to add icons

### Continued development
The development of this project can be continued by adding a search filter functionality, an e-commerce newsletter, activate the slider function for product section in homepage. In the near future, I'm going to explore react js search filters and maybe add that functionality myself.
